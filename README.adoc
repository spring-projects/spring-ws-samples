Services]. See the README within each sample project for more information and
additional instructions.

== Running the Server

Most of the sample apps can be built and run using the following commands from
within the `server` folder.

----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Or alternatively, run the following to create runnable JAR file that will run anywhere there's a JDK:

----
$ ./mvnw package
----

== Running the Client(s)

Most of the sample apps have a separate `client` directory containing clients
that connect to the server. You can run these clients by using the following
command from within each of client subdirectories:

----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
