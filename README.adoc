= Spring Web Services Samples

https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws[Spring Web Services] is a product of the Spring community focused on creating
document-driven, contract-first Web services. This repository contains sample
projects illustrating usage of Spring Web Services.

== Spring Boot 3.0.x + Spring WS 4.0.x

This version of the samples focuses on Spring WS 4.0.x, the generation provided by Spring Boot 3 up to Spring Boot 3.4.

== Sample Applications

The following sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws[Spring Web
Services]. See the README within each sample project for more information and
additional instructions.

* link:./airline[airline] - a complete airline sample that shows both Web Service and
O/X Mapping functionality in a complete application
* link:./echo[echo] - a simple sample that shows a bare-bones Echo service
* link:./mtom[mtom] - shows how to use MTOM and JAXB2 marshalling

* link:./tutorial[tutorial] - contains the code from the Spring-WS tutorial
* link:./weather[weather] - shows how to connect to a public SOAP service

== Running the Server

Most of the sample apps can be built and run using the following commands from
within the `server` folder.

----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Or alternatively, run the following to create runnable JAR file that will run anywhere there's a JDK:

----
$ ./mvnw package
----

== Running the Client(s)

Most of the sample apps have a separate `client` directory containing clients
that connect to the server. You can run these clients by using the following
command from within each of client subdirectories:

----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
